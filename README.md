# CM2030_solarSystem
This project implements a series of orbs that orbit each other.

This project was for exploring 2D transformations. A solar system like effect was created. 

This was one of four mini projects that amounted to my Midterm submission for CM2030 Graphics Programming

The other projects were:
  
  CM2030_angryBirds
  CM2030_asteroidClone
  CM2030_solarSystem

This project utilizes JavaScript, and the p5.js library to create the graphics effects showcased.
